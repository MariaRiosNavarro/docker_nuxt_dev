# Nuxt-DEV in docker

### HOW i did the NUXT_IMAGE & create the CONTAINER

### Step 1

1. Create a development Docker container with the minimum Node.js version required for Nuxt, which is version 18.

2. Wait for it to finish when you see this message.

3. Install Nuxt in the environment (select nuxi@3.11.1, yes).

4. Choose your package manager (I use npm).

5. We do not need a repository since we will only copy the files in another folder, and we will not need this development Docker container later.

6. The project is installed.

7. Enter the folder

8. MOST IMPORTANTLY, run `npm i` in this environment, and do not close the terminal, or you will lose everything (development environment only).

### Step 2

1. Open another terminal without closing the previous one, navigate to the location where you want to develop your project. Find the ID of the container created in the first terminal using `docker ps`

2. Copy the contents of the image to the desired location using  `docker cp saved_id:your_folder_name .`
  DO NOT FORGET THE TRAILING PERIOD

3. Check that it has been created using `ls` and navigate to the folder using `cd your_folder_name` and open your IDE, I use vsc for this, so I use  `. code`

### Step 3

NOTE: In the examples, from this step onwards, my shell path in my IDE will change since I removed an intermediate folder called docker-vite-nuxt.

1. In the IDE (I use vsc), create `.dockerignore`, `Dockerfile`y `docker-compose.yml`  (Do not panic if your folder is not identical to mine, I also created files `.env` and for this readme, I saved my assets in a folder, but you do not need it for your image).

![DockerNuxt](/readme_assets/step3/three1.png)

.dockerignore

```
# Node dependencies
node_modules

# Local env files
.env
.env.*
!.env.example

```

Dockerfile

```
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /nuxt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm","run", "dev", "--", "--host"]

```

docker-compose.yml
Here you choose the port where you want to use your APP, I wanted to leave the 3000 free so I use the 3030, use whatever you want, if you don't care and want to use the same one just put 3000:3000.

```
version: "3"

services:
  nuxt:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3030:3000"

```

2. Create the Nuxt_DEV image using `docker build -t name_of_the_image_you_want .` This will read the Dockerfile and create an image based on it. If you are using Docker Desktop, you will see the image and its ID (the number below). You can also use`docker ps`and see it in the terminal. Copy and save the ID.

3. Now you can create a container from this image with the volume direction in your project

3.1. You can do:

````
docker run -d -p new_port_you_want:port_in_dockerfile -v ${pwd}:PATH_OF_YOUR_IMAGE --name NAME_TO_YOUR_CONTAINER_you_WANT name_or_ID_of_the_image
````

3.2. Another way (I had problems with the relative address with `${pwd}`) is:

```
docker run -d -p new_port_you_want:port_in_dockerfile -v ABSOLUTE_PATH_YOUR_WORK_APP:PATH_OF_YOUR_IMAGE  --name NAME_TO_YOUR_CONTAINER_you_WANT name_or_ID_of_the_image

```
